# VBA-challenge
I've done all the requested tasks

I ran my script and it took about 20 minutes to do it, then I've done the screenshots that you will see and they match the pictures in the assignment but then I've seen that you have to do the "Yearly Change" column as currency and you have to do conditional formating on the "Percent Change" column which I didn't realize. I've added all that to my code and you will be able to see it but not on the screenshots, because I didn't want to run it again and give my computer a hard time hah. Also I did the conditional formatting with VBA so I hope that is what the task was. I know we can do it in a different way but we've done all that last week.

Please see attached all the files requested:)
